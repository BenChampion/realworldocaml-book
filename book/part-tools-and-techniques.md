<!-- TODO: This isn't actually markdown, right? I tried to but in a ~

\noindent Part II builds on the basics by working through useful tools and
  techniques for addressing common practical applications, from
  command-line parsing to asynchronous network programming. Along the

  together into real libraries and tools that combine different
  features of the language to good effect.

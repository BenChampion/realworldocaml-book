# The OCaml Platform

So far in the book, we've gone through a number of techniques you can
use to build real OCaml programs.  We'll now wrap up this part by
examining the tools you can use for editing, compiling, testing,
documenting and publishing your own projects.

The OCaml community has adopted a platform of modern tools to specify your project
metadata and interface it with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, to generate API
documentation, and also to adopt modern software engineering practises such as
continuous integration (CI) and testing.

## A Hello World OCaml Project

Let's start by creating a sample OCaml project and navigating around it.  opam
provides a project generator known as `spin` that can be used to create various
types of projects.

```sh dir=examples/correct/opam-spin-ls,skip
$ opam spin ls

  bin
    Native project containing a binary

  c-bindings
    Bindings to a C library

  cli
    Command Line Interface releasable on Opam

  js
    Javascript application with Js_of_ocaml

  lib
    Library releasable on Opam

  ppx
    PPX library

```

Before we dive into any of these, we'll generate a tutorial using Spin's built-in
hello world project.

<!-- ```sh dir=examples/correct/opam-spin-hello
TODO need a way to stop spin from running the opam install commands
 -->

```sh skip
$ opam spin hello hello-world -vvv

üèóÔ∏è  Creating a new project from hello in hello-world
Done!

üéÅ  Installing packages globally. This might take a couple minutes.
```

Spin will create a `hello-world` directory and populate it with a
skeleton OCaml project.  This sample project has all the metadata
required for us to learn more about the opam package manager and the
dune build tool that we've used earlier in the book.  First use opam
to install the dependencies required for our hello world project.

<!-- ```sh dir=examples/correct/hello-world -->
```
$ make deps
```

This will invoke the opam CLI to install the project dependencies and
some useful tools.  opam doesn't require any special user permissions
and stores all of the files it installs in `~/.opam` (for global
installations) and `_opam` in the working directory for the
project-local installations.  You can use `opam env` to add the right
directories to your local shell path:

```
$ eval $(opam env)
```

If you prefer not to modify your shell configuration, then you can
also invoke the build commands via `opam exec` to modify the path for
the subcommand. This is exactly what the various targets in the
`Makefile` do.

### Structure of an OCaml project

Back in [Files Modules And
Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref},
we looked at what a simple program with a couple of OCaml modules
looks like. Let's now look at the full set of files in our
`hello-world` application to examine a more realistic project
structure.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dune
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ml
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.mli
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dune
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dune-project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.opam
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dune
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.ml
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.mli
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dune
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello_test.ml
```

Some of the files here may be familiar to you from using other programming
languages:

- the `Makefile` contains targets for common actions such as `all`,
  `build`, `test` or `clean`.  It's useful to read through this to see
  which underlying OCaml tools are being invoked.
- the `LICENSE` defines the terms under which your code is made
  available, and defaults to the permissive ISC license.
- a `README.md` is a Markdown-formatted introduction to your library or application.
- the `.gitignore` file contains the patterns for generated files from
  the OCaml tools so that they can be ignored by the Git version
  control software.  If you're not familiar with using Git, look over
  one of the tutorials one such as GitHub's [git hello
  world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

The remainder of the files are either source code or metadata
files. There are three layers of names used in every OCaml project:

- **OCaml modules:** the individual `ml` and `mli` files each define
  an *OCaml module*, named after the file. Modules names are what you
  refer to when writing OCaml code -- for example, `Hello` is the
  module defined in our project.
- **ocamlfind libraries:** one or more OCaml modules can be gathered
  together into an *ocamlfind library*, providing a convenient way to
  package up some dependencies with a single name -- in this case, the
  `hello` library. Although this example contains just the single
  `Hello` module , it is common to have multiple modules per
  library. You can query the installed libraries via `ocamlfind list`
  at your command prompt.
- **opam packages:** a set of ocamlfind libraries, binaries and
  application data can all be gathered together into an *opam
  package*, in this case `hello.opam`. This is what is installed when
  you eventually publish the package and another user types in `opam
  install hello`.

It is important to understand the difference between modules,
ocamlfind libraries and opam packages, as you will use each of these
at different points of your OCaml coding journey.  The root of a
project is marked by a `dune-project` file (more on that later). We
typically structure our project into subdirectories that contain the
modules for a particular library or binary, with each directory
containing a separate `dune` file with build instructions.  In our
hello world example, we have:

- a `lib/` directory that builds a `hello` ocamlfind library.
- a `test/` directory that defines unit tests for the library.
- a `bin/` directory that uses the `hello` library to build a
  standalone application that can be executed from the command-line.

### Defining ocamlfind libraries

A project usually puts the business logic of the application into a
library rather than directly into an executable binary, since this
makes writing tests and documentation easier in addition to improving
reusability.  Let's look at `lib/dune` in more detail:

```scheme
(library
 (name hello)
 (public_name hello)
 (libraries))
```

The `(name)` field defines the project-internal name for the compiled
library, and the `(public_name)` field is what it will be called when
installed system-wide. The choice of `(name)` defines the toplevel
module exposed by this library, and every other module in the library
will be exposed as a "wrapped" submodule of that toplevel module. In
our example project `hello.ml` is exported as the `Hello` module since
it's the project name, but if we added a file called `world.ml` into
this directory the resulting module would be found in
`Hello.World`. While private library names must adhere to OCaml's
module naming convention, it's common practise to use dashes and dots
in public library names.

### Writing test cases for a library

The `(libraries)` field in the `hello` dune file is empty since this
is a standalone library. Our next step is to define a test case in
`test/dune` for our library.

```scheme
(test
 (name hello_test)
 (libraries alcotest hello))
```

The `(test)` field builds an executable binary that is run when you
invoke `dune runtest`.  In this case, it uses the `test/hello_test.ml`
module to define the test cases and depends on the external `alcotest`
library _and_ the locally defined `hello` library.  Once you run the
tests, you can find the built artefacts in `_build/default/test/` in
your project checkout.  You can use all the tests you learnt about in
[Testing](testing.html#testing){data-type=xref} here, including inline
tests.

### Building an executable program

Finally, we want to actually use our hello world from the
command-line. This is defined in `bin/dune` in a very similar fashion
to test cases.

```scheme
(executable
 (name main)
 (public_name hello)
 (libraries hello))
```

Much like libraries, the `(name)` field here has to adhere to OCaml
module naming conventions, and the `public_name` field represents the
binary name that is installed onto the system and just needs to be a
valid Unix or Windows filename.

You can build and execute the command locally using `dune exec` and
the public name of the executable:

```sh dir=examples/correct/hello-world
$ dune exec -- hello
Hello world!
```

## Setting up an integrated development environment

Now that we've seen the basic structure of the OCaml project, it's
time to setup an integrated development environment. An IDE is
particularly useful for use with OCaml due to the extra information
you gain from the static type information present in the codebase. A
good IDE will provide you with the facilities to browse interface
documentation, see inferred types for code, and to jump to the
definitions of external modules.

### Using Visual Studio Code

The recommended IDE for newcomers to OCaml is [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) using the [OCaml Platform
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform).
The plugin uses the Language Server Protocol to communicate with your
opam and dune environment. All you need to do is to install the OCaml
LSP server via opam:

```
opam install ocaml-lsp-server
```

Once installed, the VSCode OCaml plugin will ask you which opam
sandbox to use. Just the default one should be sufficient get you
going with building and browsing your interfaces.

### Browsing interface documentation

The OCaml LSP server understands how to interface with dune and
examine the built artefacts, so opening your local project in VS Code
is sufficient to activate all the features.  Try navigating over to
`bin/main.ml`, where you will see the invocation to the `hello`
library.

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello-world/bin/main.ml -->
```
let () =
  let greeting = Hello.greet "world" in
  print_endline greeting
```

First perform a build of the project to generate the type annotation
files. Then hover your mouse over the `Hello.greet` function -- you
should see some documentation pop up about the function and its
arguments.  This information comes from the _docstrings_ written into
the `hello.mli` interface file in the library.

<!-- $DISABLEDMDX file=examples/correct/hello-world/lib/hello.mli -->
```
(** This is a docstring, as it starts with "(**", as opposed to normal comments
    that start with "(*".

    The top-most docstring of the module should contain a description of the
    module, what it does, how to use it, etc.

    The function-specific documentation located below the function signatures. *)

val greet : string -> string
(** This is the docstring for the [greet] function.

    A typical documentation for this function would be:

    Returns a greeting message.

    {4 Examples}

    {[ print_endline @@ greet "Jane" ]} *)
```

Documentation strings are parsed by the
[odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc) tool generate HTML and PDF
documentation from a collection of opam packages.  If you intend your
code to be used by anyone else (or indeed, by yourself a few months
later) you should take the time to annotate your OCaml signature files
with documentation.  An easy way to preview the HTML documentation is
to build it locally with dune:

```skip
$ opam install odoc
$ dune build @doc
```

This will leave the HTML files in `_build/default/_doc/_html`, which
you can view normally with a webbrowser.

### Autoformatting your source code

As you develop more OCaml code, you'll find it convenient to have it formatted to a common style.  The `ocamlformat` tool can help you do this easily from within VSCode.

```skip
$ echo 'version=0.19.0' > .ocamlformat
$ opam install ocamlformat.0.19.0
```

The `.ocamlformat` file controls the autoformatting options available,
and fixes the version of the tool that is used. You can upgrade to a
newer ocamlformat version whenever you want, but it is a manual
process to avoid an upstream release autoreformatting your project
code without your intervention.  You can examine the formatting
options via `ocamlformat --help` -- most of the time the defaults
should be fine.

Once you've got ocamlformat configured, you can either format your
project from within VSCode (`shift-alt-F` being the default), or by
running:

```skip
$ dune build @fmt
```

This will generate a set of reformatted files in the build directory,
which you can accept with `dune promote` as you did earlier in the
testing chapter.

## Publishing your code online

With your IDE set up you'll quickly develop useful OCaml code and want
to share it with others.  We'll now go through how to define opam
packages, set up continuous integration and publish your code.

### Defining opam packages

The only metadata file that is really _required_ to participate in the
open-source OCaml ecosystem is an `opam` file in your source tree.
Each `opam` file defines an *opam package* -- a collection of OCaml
libraries and executable binaries or application data.  Each opam
package can define dependencies on other opam packages, and includes
build and testing directions for your project. The `hello.opam` file
in our sample project is quite easy to read:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello-world/hello.opam -->
```
# This file is generated by dune, edit dune-project instead
opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "A short description of the project"
description: "A short description of the project"
maintainer: ["Your name"]
authors: ["Your name"]
license: "ISC"
homepage: "https://github.com/username/hello"
doc: "https://username.github.io/hello/"
bug-reports: "https://github.com/username/hello/issues"
depends: [
  "ocaml" {>= "4.08.0"}
  "dune"
  "alcotest" {with-test}
  "odoc" {with-doc}
]
build: [
  ["dune" "subst"] {pinned}
  [
    "dune"
    "build"
    "-p"
    name
    "-j"
    jobs
    "@install"
    "@runtest" {with-test}
    "@doc" {with-doc}
  ]
]
dev-repo: "git+https://github.com/username/hello.git"
```

The fields in here all represent project metadata ranging from textual
descriptions, to project URLs, to other opam package dependencies.  A
collection of `opam` files can be stored in an *opam repository* to
create a package database, with a central one for the OCaml ecosystem
available at <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository>.  The official
(but not exclusive) tool used for manipulating `opam` files is the
eponymous [opam package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org) that we've
been using throughout this book.

### Generating project metadata from dune

You don't need to write the opam file by hand -- instead, we can use
define our project metadata using the dune build system and have it
autogenerated for us.  We've already been using the `dune` build tool
from back in [Files Modules And
Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref}. We're
now going to look at how to configure your project for use with dune.

The root directory of an OCaml project built by dune has a
`dune-project` file that defines the project metadata. In our hello
world example, it starts with:

```scheme
(lang dune 2.0)
```

The line above is the version of the syntax used in your build files,
and _not_ the actual version of the `dune` binary.  One of the nicest
features of dune is that it is forwards-compatible with older
metadata. By defining the version of the dune language that you are
currently using, _future_ versions of dune will do their best to
emulate the current behaviour until you chose to upgrade your project.

The rest of the `dune-project` file defines other useful project metadata:

```scheme
(name hello)
(documentation "https://username.github.io/hello/")
(source (github username/hello))
(license ISC)
(authors "Your name")
(maintainers "Your name")
(generate_opam_files true)
```

The fields here should look familiar -- they were also present in the
`hello.opam` file above.  That's because dune can generate the opam
packaging metadata files for you and avoid duplication.  Go ahead and
edit the metadata above, and then build the project with:

```skip
$ dune build
```

The build command will update the `hello.opam` file in your source
tree as well, keeping it in sync with your changes.  The final part of
the `dune-project` file contains dependency information for other
packages your project depends on.

```scheme
(package
 (name hello)
 (synopsis "A short description of the project")
 (description "A short description of the project")
 (depends
  (ocaml (>= 4.08.0))
  (alcotest :with-test)
  (odoc :with-doc)))
```

The `(package)` stanza here refers to opam packages, both for the name
and for the dependency specifications.  This is in contrast to the
`dune` files which refer to ocamlfind libraries, since those represent
the compilation units for OCaml code (whereas opam packages are
broader collections of package data).

Notice that the dependency specification can also include version
information. One of the key features of opam is that each repository
contains multiple versions of the same package.  The opam CLI contains
a constraint solver that will find versions of all dependencies that
are compatible with your current project.  When you add a dependency,
you can therefore specify lower and upper version bounds as required
by your use of that package.  The `with-test` and `with-doc` are
further constraints that only add those dependencies for test and
documentation generation respectively.

Once you've defined your opam and dune dependencies, you can run
various lint commands to check that your metadata is consistent.

```skip
$ opam dune-lint
$ opam lint
```

The `opam-dune-lint` plugin will check that the ocamlfind libraries
and opam packages in your dune files match up, and offer to fix them
up if it spots a mismatch. `opam lint` runs additional checks on the
opam files within your project.

### Setting up Continuous Integration

Once you have your project metadata defined, it's a good time to begin
hosting it online.  Two of the most popular platforms for this are
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).  The
remainder of this chapter will assume you are using GitHub for
simplicity, although you are encouraged to check out the alternatives
to find the best solution for your own needs.

When you create a GitHub repository and push your code to it, you can
also add an OCaml GitHub Action that will install the OCaml Platform
tools and run your code across various architectures and operating
systems.  You can find the full documentation online at the [GitHub
Setup OCaml](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml)
marketplace.  Configuring an action is as simple as adding a
`.github/workflows/test.yml` file to your project that looks something
like this:

```yaml
name: Hello world workflow
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os:
          - macos-latest
          - ubuntu-latest
          - windows-latest
        ocaml-compiler:
          - 4.13.x
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use OCaml ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
        uses: ocaml/setup-ocaml@v2
        with:
          ocaml-compiler: ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
      - run: opam install . --deps-only --with-test
      - run: opam exec -- dune build
      - run: opam exec -- dune runtest
```

This workflow file will run your project on OCaml installations on
Windows, macOS and Linux, using the latest patch release of OCaml
4.13.  Notice that it also runs the test cases you have defined
earlier on all those different operating systems as well.  You can do
an awful lot of customisation of these continuous integration
workflows, so refer to the online documentation for more options.

### Releasing your code into the opam repository

Once your continuous integration is passing, you are all set to try to
tag a release of your project and share it with other users!  The
OCaml Platform supplies a convenient tool called `dune-release` which
automates much of this process for you.

```skip
$ opam install dune-release
```

The first thing you need to do is to create a `CHANGES.md` file in
your project in Markdown format, which contains a header per version.
This is typically a succinct summary of the changes between versions
that can be read by users.  For our first release, we might have:

```
## v1.0.0

- Initial public release of our glorious hello world
  project (@avsm)
- Added test cases for making sure we do in fact hello world.
```

Commit this file to your repository in the root. Before you proceed
with a release, you need to make sure that all of your local changes
have been pushed to the remote GitHub repository, and that your
working tree is clean.  You can do this by using git:

```
$ git clean -dxf
$ git diff
```

This will remove any untracked files from the local checkout (such as
the `_build` directory) and check that tracked files are unmodified.
We should now be ready to perform the release!  First create a git tag
to mark this release:

```skip
$ dune-release tag
```

This will parse your `CHANGES.md` file and figure out the latest
version, and create a local git tag in your repository after prompting
you. Once that succeeds, you can start the release process via:

```skip
$ dune-release
```

This will begin an interactive session where you will need to enter
some GitHub authentication details (via creating a personal access
token).  Once that is completed, the tool will run all local tests,
generate documentation and upload it to your GitHub pages branch for
that project, and finally offer to open a pull request to the central
opam-repository.  Recall that the central opam package set is all just
a normal git repository, and so your opam file will be added to that
and your GitHub account will create a PR.

At this point, you can sit back and relax while the central opam
repository test system runs your package through a battery of
installations (including on exotic architectures you might not access
to, such as S390X mainframes or 32-bit ARMv7).  If there is a problem
detected, some friendly maintainers from the OCaml community will
comment on the pull request and guide you through how to address it.
You can simply delete the git tag and re-run the release process until
the package is merged.  Once it is merged, you can navigate to the
<ocaml.org> site and view it online in an hour or so.  It will also be
available in the central repository for other users to install.
